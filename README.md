* data.dart file contains the API call and the model for the video data.
* home_screen.dart contains custom app bar widget, under that I built a video card to show all the videos recieved from the API.
* On the video card, I used **GestureDetector** to idenitfy the tap and redirect the user to vide0 player screen.
